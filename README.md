# Computer_Vision
Collection of labs projects of different courses/practice related to computer vision. Currently it includes SSY098 - Image Analysis (MATLAB), and increasing tasks related to my undergraduate course Image Processing(MATLAB), which are being rewritten by C++ with OpenCV. In the future I hope to learn computer vision with deep learning, by C++ or Python.
